I studied MulitMediaTechnology at the University of Applied Sciences, Salzburg, Austria with a focus on Game Development,
which I will complete in April 2023 with a Masters degree. 
In addition to coding games, I also have interests in other fields like computer graphics or deep learning and 
am always looking to expand my knowledge and learn something new.

Off the clock I enjoy the occasional game, prefferable (local) muliplayer-party games I can play
with my friends or horror games for an adrenaline kick.
Furthermore, I love Yoga as well as reading, travelling or having a cup of coffee.

I'm open to work opportunities or collaborations, just shoot me a message with your idea and we can talk about it,
I'd love to hear from you!
