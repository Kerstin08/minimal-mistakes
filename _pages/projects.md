Every character has special abilities has special abilities that either help to score a goal or to prevent the other team from scoring. \\

This project was the graduation project for my Bachelor studies at the Universities of Applied Sciences Salzburg. It was developed in 
Unreal 4 by a total of 3 programmers and 5 artists. In this team my primary role was Gameplay development, where I took on tasks as needed and
therefore was envolved in everything from character movement, over gameplay, like time and score management, to UI implementations.

This project was the graduation project for my Master studies at the Universities of Applied Sciences Salzburg. It was developed in 
Unreal 4 by a total of 2 programmers and 5 artists. In this team my primary role was AI development, which involved implementing the human occupant of the
house. I was also responsible to incoperate the sound provided by our sound designer. Furthermore, I helped out as needed with several coding tasks as well as developed various parts
of the prototype to test several mechanics before the actual development process started. Since the important game design alterations where decided by the whole team, 
I also took part in the design process, which however was not my main resposibility.
